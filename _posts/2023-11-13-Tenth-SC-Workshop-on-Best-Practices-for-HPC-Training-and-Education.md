abstract: >
  Throughout the cyberinfrastructure community there is a large range of resources available to train faculty and young scholars about successful utilization of computational resources for research. The challenge that the community faces is that training materials abound, but they can be difficult to find, and often have little information about the quality or relevance of offerings. Building on existing software technology, we propose to build a way for the community to better share and find training and education materials, through a federated training repository. In this scenario, organizations and authors retain physical and legal ownership of their materials by sharing only catalog information, organizations can refine local portals to use the best and most appropriate materials from both local and remote sources, and learners can take advantage of materials that are reviewed and described more clearly.
